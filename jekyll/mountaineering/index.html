<p>
I have always been interested in mountaineering ever since my parents
took me on holiday to Snowdonia. In the 1970′s and 80′s I was a very
active climber and was fortunate to live in the Peak District with
climbs on my doorstep. A move back to Cheshire and the arrival of
three children have meant that I have been much less active in recent
years. However, the children are growing up and have started to take
an interest in mountaineering and we have done some good routes
together.

<p>
There are links to articles about our recent climbs and also some
older writings from the 1980′s. Please note that I tend to write about
climbs where things go wrong, we don’t always have epics!
