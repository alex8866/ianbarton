<p>
I have been using MythTV for a couple of years now. Like most complex
bits of software, it can be difficult to get it set up the way that
you want it. There are a number of comprehensive guides to installing
Myth on various flavours of Linux elsewhere on the Internet. These
pages are not a HowTo on installing MythTV, but contain hints and tips
that have helped me fine tune my system.
</p>
<p>
If you want to build Myth from svn see <a href="http://www.ian-barton.com/wiki/MythTV/CompilingFromSVN">compiling MythTV from svn</a> .

<h2 id="sec-1">Hauppauge Nova-T 500.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>This card contains twin DVB tuners. It's supported out of the box by
Feisty, but you may experience problems with usb disconnects causing
kernel panics. If your box locks up periodically for no apparent
reason this may be the cause. One solution is to disable the EIT
program guide in Myth and use mythfilldatabase instead. It's also
possible to install the latest <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hauppauge_WinTV_Nova-T_500_PCI dvb">drivers</a> , which seem to have made a big
difference for me.
</p>
<p>
There is a good page about the card in the MythTV <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hauppauge_WinTV_Nova-T_500_PCI">wiki</a> . One useful
tip is to make sure that you turn on the on board amplifier:
</p>
<p>
{% highlight bash %}
sudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/options
Add the following to the end of the file: 
options dvb-usb-dib0700 force<sub>lna</sub><sub>activation</sub>=1 
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="sec-2">Using mythrename.pl.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>In the contribute scripts directory MyThTV contains a script called mythrename.pl, which will rename your recordings to a more human readable format. By default Myth creates file names of the format:
</p>
<p>
{% highlight bash %}
[ChannelID]<sub>[Year][Month][Hour][Min][Sec]</sub>.mpg
{% endhighlight %}
</p>
<p>
If you want to copy your recordings somewhere else, it can be
difficult to identify the correct file. Running mythrename.pl with no
parameters will rename your files in the format:
</p>
<p>
At first this seemed like a "good idea". However, various other Myth
utilities expect the file names to be in the default format. One
example is mythtranscode. So what happens if you have run
mythrename.pl and want to restore your file names to the default
format? You can use mythrename.pl to restore the original format:
</p>
<p>
{% highlight perl %}
mythrename.pl &ndash;format '%c_%Y%m%d%H%i%s' &ndash;live
{% endhighlight %}
</p>
<p>
Now you can use mythrename with the &ndash;link option to create symlinks
with pretty file names to the original files.

<h2 id="sec-3">Trimming Recordings.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>Myth has various automated methods for marking adverts in
recordings. None of these work well for me here in the UK. For most
programs I simply fast forward past the adverts. However, if I want to
keep a recording I mark the adverts manually using edit mode.
</p>
<p>
Initially I found that editing recorded files to cut out the ads was
problematic. The reason was the nature of the mpg files produced from
DVB cards by Myth. There seems to be a 300 msec delay between the
audio and video track. If you just watch the program this is not
noticeable. However, once you start trying to edit the files, audio
and video rapidly get noticeably out of sync.
</p>
<p>
One solution is to demux the mpg file using ProjectX and then
re-multiplex the streams. However, this is quite labour intensive and
time consuming. Luckily mythtranscode has an option that will fix
errors in recorded mpg files. As a starting point I use the <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Removing_Commercials">script</a>
from the MythTV wiki. I modified it as I don't want automatic
commercial flagging.
</p>
<p>
I have set this script up as a user job, so I can run it when
required.

<h2 id="sec-4">Encoding Video for an Archos 404.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

<p>I recently bought an Archos multimedia player and I wanted an easy way
to re-encode my MythTV recordings in a format suitable for the Archos.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of scripts around for converting MythTV recordings into PDA and iPod compatible formats. Benton Roberts has created a nice Perl script that helps you create a set of shell scripts for processing MythTV recordings. You can download his scripts from <a href="http://bentonroberts.com/personal/media-server/code/mythshelljob | here">http://bentonroberts.com/personal/media-server/code/mythshelljob | here</a> . The main script can be run either as a user job, or from a command line. One of the nice things about his scripts is the ability to create a job definition file. This is a simple text file the script uses to determine things like encoding parameters and output file name. If your household has several multimedia devices you can create a job definition file for each device and choose which one to run from the main script.

<h2 id="sec-5">Creating Time-stamped Backups Using cron.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">

<p>It's quite easy to backup your database using mysqldump. However, what
happens if you discover a problem with the database that occured a few
days ago? Simply dumping the database once a day won't help you, as
your backup file will contain the error. The solution is to create
daily backups. Each backup is a compressed .tgz file with the name in
the format mysql-dd-mm-yyyy.tgz.
</p>
<p>
Don't forget to clear out your backup directory once in a while, or
your hard drive will eventually fill up! If your hard disk crashes,
having multiple backups won't help you, so you probably need another
cron job to rsync your backups to another computer.

<h2 id="sec-6">Problems Tuning Some Freeview Channels.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">

<p>Myth has been having problems tuning certain Freeview channels,
including BBC4, Channel5 and Radio 4. However, I can receive these
channels with no problem using Kaffeine, so the hardware and signal
strength must be OK. My database is quite old, having originated at
about MythTV 0.17. I had tried various options to re-tune, but the
problem persisted. In case anyone else is experiencing th same sort of
trouble this is how I fixed it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Create a channels.conf file using scan (tzap). Make sure that you stop mythbackend first.

</li>
</ul>

<p>{% highlight bash %}
scan -c /usr/share/doc/dvb-utils/examples/scan/dvb-t/uk-WinterHill &gt; channels.conf
{% endhighlight %}
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Run mythtv-setup and delete all existing channels. Run the channel scanner with the option to use channels.conf '''and''' delete existing channels.

</li>
</ul>

<p>Myth can now tune all the Freeview channels correctly.
