<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>We have several Pundits around the house and they tend to ship with
rather old BIOS revisions. In an attempt to try and fix a problem with
my Pundit AH-2 sometimes refusing to recognise a SATA hard disk, I
wanted to upgrade the BIOS to the latest version. The Pundit doesn't
have a floppy and I didn't want all the hassle of trying to make a
bootable DOS CD with all the right software installed. Luckily I found
out that pressing '''Alt-F2''' during the POST sequence will drop you
into the built in EZ Flash utility. You might need a couple of
attempts to get to the utility - wait until the Asus splash screen
appears, hold down the alt key and repeatedly bash F2.

There is one gotcha the downloaded BIOS images have file names like
P1AH2<sub>404</sub>.BIN. You will need to rename the extracted file to
P1AH2.BIN, or the EZ flash utility will complain that it can't load
the file. So the procedure is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Rename the bin file to the correct name eg. P1AH2.BIN
</li>
<li>
Burn BIN file to CD and insert into Pundit.
</li>
<li>
Reboot. Hold down the Alt key when the Asus splash screen appears and keep pressing F2 until you get into the EZ Flash utility.
</li>
</ul>
